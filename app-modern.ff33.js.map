architectures.\n              After obtaining my Bachelor&apos;s Degree in computer science, I gained experience from the startup world, where I used\n              JavaScript intensively during both my professional life and spare time. Eventually it led me to teach others about these\n              topics and to offer online courses and on-site consulting for companies.
