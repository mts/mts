function at each node in the traversal, and calling the\n * leave function after visiting that node and all of its child nodes.\n *\n * By returning different values from the enter and leave functions, the\n * behavior of the visitor can be altered, including skipping over a sub-tree of\n * the AST (by returning false), editing the AST by returning a value or null\n * to remove the value, or to stop the whole traversal by returning BREAK.\n *\n * When using visit() to edit an AST, the original AST will not be modified, and\n * a new version of the AST with the changes applied will be returned from the\n * visit function.\n *\n *     const editedAST = visit(ast, {\n *       enter(node, key, parent, path, ancestors) {\n *         // @return\n *         //   undefined: no action\n *         //   false: skip visiting this node\n *         //   visitor.BREAK: stop visiting altogether\n *         //   null: delete this node\n *         //   any value: replace this node with the

providing enter() and leave() functions, a visitor can\n * instead provide functions named the same as the kinds of AST nodes, or\n * enter/leave visitors at a named key, leading to four permutations of\n * visitor API:\n *\n * 1) Named visitors triggered when entering a node a specific kind.\n *\n *     visit(ast, {\n *       Kind(node) {\n *         // enter the \"Kind\" node\n *       }\n *     })\n *\n * 2) Named visitors that trigger upon entering and leaving a node of\n *    a specific kind.\n *\n *     visit(ast, {\n *       Kind: {\n *         enter(node) {\n *           // enter the \"Kind\" node\n *         }\n *         leave(node) {\n *           // leave the \"Kind\" node\n *         }\n *       }\n *     })\n *\n * 3) Generic visitors that trigger upon entering and leaving any node.\n *\n *     visit(ast, {\n *       enter(node) {\n *         // enter any node\n *       },\n *       leave(node) {\n *         // leave any node\n *       }\n *     })\n *\n * 4) Parallel
